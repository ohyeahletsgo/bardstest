After an exciting night, the band goes to the jail and Willard, looking for clues about Davos' father, but to no avail. As they pass by the bar, Davos thinks to stop in and ask the bartender if he has any information. Reluctantly, the barkeep says that prominent members of the Broken Skulls wear two silver rings, one on each hand. With only that information, the band resigns to playing in the concert.

Just before their performance, Davos notices something wrong with the stage. Upon investigation, Davos triggers a device that reveals that both Davos' father and Willard are hanging by a noose to the arch of the stage. A cloaked figure appears above them and engages the band in combat.

The cloaked figure is a skilled fighter, gracefully countering each of the band member's attacks. The fight is mistaken by the audience as a high-quality performance. Shim, casts an ice dagger spell that hits the figure in the chest and explodes, killing the figure. Terrence and Davos are able to free Davos' father and Willard from their nooses and Calista casts feather fall on them. The band finishes three songs in a perfect performance.

Backstage, the band learns that the figure's name was Zura and was a lieutenant in the Broken Skulls' ranks. The band obtains his cloak, silver rings, a gold amulet, 200 gold, and possibly-cursed magical dagger.

The next day, the votes are in and the band wins the night's performance in a landslide. Along with the band, the Anduweir Boys advance to the next stage of preliminaries in the Battle of the Bands, which will take place in the country of Thrain in the Capital of Silver Flame.
